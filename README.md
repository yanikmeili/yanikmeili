→ I spent my childhood in Switzerland before moving to Brazil at age ten. I graduated from the French High School of São Paulo, where I became quadrilingual after     learning Spanish and English in addition to Portuguese and French.

  I decided to become a developer during my experience at the startup Amenitiz. The link I had to do with the tech team made me fall in love with this art.           Therefore I joined Le Wagon, and  now I wish to deepen my knowledge in the coding word.
